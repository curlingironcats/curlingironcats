# CS325 - GitHub Pages Project

## 🌐 Live Website

## About
Instead of cloning someone else's template, I decided to reuse and enhance a previous portfolio website I built while working through the **Python Crash Course** book. I made some improvements:

- **Smooth page animations** for a more polished experience.
- **Reorganized structure** to work with GitHub Pages. Previously I was using **Django** as a web framework, which dynamically loads content. I changed the content references to be static.
- **New Graphic Designs** to better showcase my projects.

I chose to build on my previous project because I feel it already puts my best foot forward in terms of a presentable website for employers, and it allowed me to focus on improving my existing project rather than starting from scratch.

## Deployment
I learned the **GitHub Pages deployment process**, as well as how to make small updates and push the changes to a live website.
